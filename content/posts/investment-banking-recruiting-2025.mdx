# Breaking Into Investment Banking in 2025: What You Need to Know

After years of layoffs, reduced bonuses, and frozen hiring, investment banking is experiencing a genuine inflection point. M&A volume isn't just picking up—deals are finally crossing the finish line. Banks are ramping up interviews with renewed aggression, and the competition for top talent has intensified.

The numbers tell the story. JPMorgan Chase reported a 49% increase in IB revenue. Goldman Sachs' profit rose 105%. Citigroup saw a 35% jump. Senior MDs who were hired during the slowdown are now building execution teams, creating sharp demand for Analysts, Associates, and VPs who can deliver immediate impact.

But more hiring doesn't mean easier hiring. If anything, banks have learned from the 2021-2022 frenzy. As one senior recruiter put it: "In 2021, you just needed bodies—more horsepower. This is very different. Nobody wants a redo."

## The New Recruiting Reality

Several trends define IB recruiting in 2025. Off-cycle hiring has increased significantly, giving candidates more entry points throughout the year. Full-time opportunities have expanded beyond the traditional summer analyst conversion path. And timelines have accelerated dramatically—some banks opened 2026 summer internship applications as early as December 2024, meaning candidates now make career decisions up to 18 months before their potential start date.

The interview-to-offer ratio has also shifted. Banks are interviewing 8-10 candidates for every position they fill. The bar hasn't just been raised—it's moved to a different level entirely. Top firms report median GPAs of 3.7 for hired analysts, with many setting hard cutoffs at 3.5. School prestige still matters: elite programs provide roughly 40% of bulge-bracket recruits, and first-round interview invites go to 60-70% of applicants from target schools versus only 20-30% from non-targets.

None of this means breaking in is impossible from a non-traditional background. But it does mean you need to be strategic about how you position yourself.

## What Banks Actually Want

The core requirements remain unchanged: strong financial modeling skills, M&A experience (or demonstrated aptitude), and sector knowledge. You still need to know your way around a DCF, understand the mechanics of an LBO, and speak fluently about valuation methodologies.

What's evolved is the additional layer banks now expect. Data analysis capabilities, familiarity with AI tools, and digital infrastructure knowledge have moved from nice-to-have to genuinely valued. Banks are modernizing their operations, and they want junior bankers who can contribute to that evolution.

More importantly, banks want candidates who think like dealmakers. Keeping up with headlines isn't enough—you need to articulate the "why" behind major transactions. Have 2-3 recent deals ready to discuss in depth: the strategic rationale, valuation impact, regulatory challenges, and outcome. Choose transactions relevant to the groups you're interviewing with.

Communication skills matter more than ever. The technical screen gets you in the door, but your ability to present ideas clearly, work under pressure, and build client relationships determines whether you advance.

## The Interview Gauntlet

Investment banking interviews are uniquely demanding. They combine rigorous technical assessment with behavioral evaluation and market awareness testing—often across multiple rounds with different interviewers.

Technical questions form the core. Expect deep dives into accounting principles, financial statement analysis, and valuation methodologies. "Walk me through a DCF." "What's the difference between enterprise value and equity value?" "How do you calculate free cash flow from net income?" "Walk me through an LBO." These aren't trick questions—they're baseline competency checks. If you stumble here, the interview is effectively over.

The technical bar rises with seniority. Analyst candidates face foundational corporate finance concepts. Associates and lateral hires encounter more complex scenario analysis, deal structuring questions, and market-specific challenges.

Behavioral questions assess cultural fit and predict future performance. Banks want to understand how you've navigated complex challenges, your methods for decision-making under pressure, and whether you'll thrive in the demanding IB environment. The STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) remains the gold standard for structuring these responses.

What's new in 2025 is the emphasis on real-world application. Memorizing answers is no longer sufficient. Interviewers want to see you reason through problems live, connect financial theory to practical scenarios, and communicate with clarity and confidence. Automated pre-screening and AI-driven assessments mean your answers need to be structured and digitally polished from the very first interaction.

## How to Prepare

Start structured preparation 2-3 months before your target interview dates. This isn't something you cram for in a week.

Build your technical foundation systematically. Cover accounting, DCF, LBO, and trading multiples until the mechanics are second nature. Use resources like Rosenbaum & Pearl's "Investment Banking" textbook, Wall Street Oasis guides, and platforms like IB Vine that offer real interview questions reported across dozens of banks.

Develop your deal discussions with the same rigor. Pick transactions relevant to your target groups and prepare to discuss them from multiple angles: why the deal made strategic sense, how it was valued, what challenges arose, and what the outcome was.

Practice behavioral responses using the STAR method, but don't over-script. Interviewers can tell when answers are rehearsed verbatim. Know your stories well enough to adapt them to different question framings.

Mock interviews are essential. The gap between knowing material and delivering it under pressure is significant. Practice with peers, mentors, or professional coaches until you can handle curveballs without losing composure.

## The Networking Imperative

Here's the uncomfortable reality: internal referrals dramatically outperform cold applications. Data shows a 35% interview-invite rate for referred candidates versus just 8% for cold online submissions.

This doesn't mean you need an uncle at Goldman Sachs. It means you need to actively build relationships in the industry before you need them. Reach out to alumni from your school. Attend recruiting events and follow up meaningfully. Connect with junior bankers on LinkedIn and ask thoughtful questions about their experience.

The candidates who break in from non-target backgrounds almost always have one thing in common: they networked relentlessly and strategically. They didn't wait for opportunities to come to them.

## Compensation Context

For those who make it through, the rewards remain substantial. Bulge-bracket analyst compensation runs $110k-$150k base with 30-75% bonuses. Associates earn $175k-$250k base with 50-100% bonuses. The hours are brutal, but the financial upside and exit opportunities continue to attract top talent.

The hottest sectors right now include tech, healthcare, restructuring, industrials, and financial institutions. AI-related dealmaking is particularly active, creating opportunities for candidates who understand both finance and technology.

## Executing Under Pressure

When you're finally in the interview seat, execution matters as much as preparation.

Structure every answer clearly. State your approach, then walk through it methodically. Interviewers evaluate dozens of candidates—make your thinking easy to follow.

Show your work on technical questions. Talking through your reasoning demonstrates mastery better than jumping straight to answers. If you make an error, acknowledge it and correct course. Composure under pressure is itself a signal.

For behavioral questions, be specific. Generic answers about "teamwork" or "leadership" don't differentiate you. Concrete stories with measurable outcomes do.

And leverage every advantage available. Real-time AI assistance tools like Interview Pilot can help you stay structured during behavioral questions, remember key technical frameworks, and maintain clarity under pressure. Running on your phone separately from your interview device, it works across video calls and in-person settings without detection.

## The Bottom Line

Investment banking recruiting in 2025 is more competitive than it's been in years—but opportunities are genuinely expanding. Banks are hiring, deals are flowing, and the candidates who prepare rigorously will find their path in.

The question isn't whether the opportunities exist. It's whether you're ready to compete for them.
