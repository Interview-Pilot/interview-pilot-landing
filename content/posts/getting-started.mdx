# How Interview Pilot Works: A Complete Guide

Interview Pilot is a mobile app that provides real-time AI assistance during live interviews. It listens to questions, transcribes them instantly, and generates personalized responses based on your background and the role you're applying for.

This guide covers everything you need to know to get started.

## The Core Concept

Traditional interview prep asks you to memorize hundreds of answers and hope the right ones come up. Interview Pilot takes a different approach: it gives you intelligent support in the moment, when you actually need it.

The app runs on your phone—completely separate from whatever device you're using for the interview. This separation is the key to how it works. Your interviewer sees your laptop or desktop screen during a video call. Your phone sits nearby, out of frame, processing the conversation and providing suggestions only you can see.

Because it operates on a separate device, there's no screen-sharing conflict, no browser extension to detect, no risk of accidentally revealing a second window. It's the same as having notes on your desk, except the notes update in real-time based on what's being asked.

## Setting Up Your Profile

The more Interview Pilot knows about you, the better its suggestions become. During setup, you'll add:

**Your resume.** Upload it directly or paste the text. The AI uses this to understand your experience, skills, and career trajectory. When a behavioral question comes up, it can reference actual projects you've worked on rather than generating generic responses.

**Job details.** For each interview, you can add the job description and company information. This helps the AI tailor responses to what the specific role requires and align with the company's priorities.

**Your preferences.** Choose how you want responses formatted. Some people prefer bullet points they can glance at quickly. Others want fuller paragraphs they can paraphrase. You can adjust response length and style to match how you naturally communicate.

The setup takes about five minutes for your first interview. After that, you're mostly just adding new job descriptions as you progress through different opportunities.

## During the Interview

When your interview starts, open the app and tap record. Interview Pilot uses OpenAI's Whisper—ranked as the world's most accurate speech recognition—to transcribe the conversation in real time. It supports 99+ languages and handles virtually any accent.

As questions come in, you have two options. You can let the AI generate responses automatically, or you can tap to request a response for a specific question. Most people prefer the manual approach for behavioral questions and automatic for rapid-fire technical scenarios.

Responses typically appear within one second. You'll see them on your phone screen while maintaining eye contact with your camera or interviewer. The goal isn't to read answers verbatim—it's to have a reference point that keeps you on track and helps you articulate your thoughts more clearly.

For technical interviews, the AI provides structured solutions with explanations. For behavioral questions, it draws on your resume to suggest relevant stories from your actual experience, formatted using frameworks like STAR. For case studies and product questions, it offers structured approaches and talking points.

## What It Handles

Interview Pilot isn't limited to coding questions. It supports the full range of interview formats:

**Technical rounds.** Algorithm problems, system design discussions, debugging exercises, and technical deep-dives. The AI explains approaches step by step and can adjust complexity based on your experience level.

**Behavioral interviews.** Leadership questions, conflict resolution, teamwork scenarios, and "tell me about yourself" narratives. Responses pull from your actual background rather than generating fictional examples.

**Case studies.** Product sense questions, market sizing, business strategy, and consulting-style cases. The AI provides frameworks and structured thinking to guide your analysis.

**Industry-specific questions.** Whether you're interviewing for fintech, healthcare, AI/ML, or any other sector, responses incorporate relevant terminology and context.

The app covers 18+ professional fields, from software engineering to consulting to investment banking.

## Practical Tips

**Position your phone strategically.** It should be visible to you but out of your camera's frame. Most people place it just below their laptop screen or to the side. Test this before your interview starts.

**Use responses as guides, not scripts.** The AI gives you structure and key points. Translate them into your own words as you speak. Interviewers can tell when someone is reading, so maintain your natural speaking rhythm.

**Practice beforehand.** Run through a few mock questions to get comfortable with the interface. Understand how quickly responses appear and how you'll glance at them naturally during conversation.

**Keep your audio clear.** The transcription works best when the interviewer's voice comes through clearly. If you're using headphones, ensure your phone's microphone can still pick up the room audio, or position it near your laptop speakers.

## Privacy and Data

Interview Pilot stores data locally on your device and in your iCloud account. App usage data is never stored on external servers. All communications use industry-standard encryption.

Your conversations aren't recorded or saved beyond your own device. The AI processes questions in real-time but doesn't retain transcripts after your session ends unless you explicitly save them for later review.

## Getting Started

The app offers a free tier that includes 3 interview sessions and 10 AI responses per week—enough to test whether it works for your situation before committing.

Paid plans start at $14.99/month and include unlimited sessions, access to the most powerful AI models, full profile customization, and priority support. There's also a quarterly option at $39 for three months.

Download Interview Pilot from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/interview-pilot-ai-copilot/id6743263009) or Google Play. Setup takes a few minutes, and you can run through practice questions immediately to see how it feels.

## When It Makes Sense

Interview Pilot is most valuable when you're facing high-stakes interviews where preparation alone isn't enough. Maybe you interview well but freeze on unexpected questions. Maybe you know the material but struggle to articulate it under pressure. Maybe you're switching industries and need help translating your experience into new contexts.

It's not a replacement for preparation—you still need to understand the fundamentals of your field. But it's a powerful supplement that helps you perform closer to your actual ability when it matters most.
